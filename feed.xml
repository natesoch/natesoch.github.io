If you’re not convinced yet, buckle up because I’m about to tell you why Michigan deserves a top spot on your list of favorite places.</p> <p>First off, we’ve got the Great Lakes. All five of them in their glory, unlike Ohio. They’re some of the largest freshwater lakes in the world (Lake Superior is largest by area), and they’re clean, making them great to swim in (Lundington State Park has some great beaches!). If you’re into swimming, boating, or just enjoying a gorgeous view, you’re in for a treat.</p> <p>Then there’s the University of Michigan. This isn’t just any college; it’s a top-tier institution with a reputation that stretches far beyond our state’s borders. Whether you’re fan of Michigan or not, you can’t ignore the academic excellence that comes out of Ann Arbor.</p> <p>Speaking of Ann Arbor, the city’s got a vibrant community with a rich arts scene, amazing food (well slightly overpriced imo), and tons of cool events. It’s a place where you can always find something interesting to do or see.</p> <p>Let’s not forget the natural beauty. Michigan’s got some seriously stunning spots. Sleeping Bear Dunes, Pictured Rocks, Isle Royale National Park and Porcupine Mountains are a few that come to mind along with all of the Great Lakes. These places are perfect for hiking, camping, or just soaking in the breathtaking scenery.</p> <p>And if you’re into quaint, historic charm, Mackinac Island has you covered. No cars allowed, just bikes and horses. It’s like stepping back in time, and the views of the lake are pretty cool.</p> <p>Traverse City is another gem. Known for its cherry orchards (highlyt recommend the Cherry Festival!) and wine country, it’s a must visit for anyone who loves good food and beautiful landscapes.</p> <p>So, there you have it. From pristine lakes and top-notch education to stunning nature and charming towns, Michigan has a little bit of everything. If you haven’t experienced it yet, you’re missing out. Trust me, once you do, you’ll see why Michigan is the best state.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why Michigan?]]></summary></entry></feed>
