Hello and welcome to my website! I am a senior studying Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan and have plans to pursue a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Originally I am Evart, Michiganâ€”a small town in the mid-north part of the state. Some of my work experience consists of interning as a software engineer at AdvantageCS, based in Ann Arbor, and as a FPGA design engineer intern this past summer at Garmin, where I worked at their headquaters in Olathe, Kansas. Check out my resume below for a more comprehensive description of these!

At my school, I am a TA for ENGR 101, an introductory programming class for engineers, where I teach a 2 hour lab section once per week and hold office hours. I also am an active officer in Eta Kappa Nu - Beta Epsilon, an EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) honor society.
