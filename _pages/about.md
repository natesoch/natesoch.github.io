Hello and welcome to my website!. I am a senior studying Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan and have plans to pursue a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

At my school, I am a TA (technically called IA, instructor assistant) for ENGR 101, an introductory programming class for engineers, where I teach a 2 hour lab section once per week and hold office hours. I also am an active officer in Eta Kappa Nu - Beta Epsilon, an EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) honor society. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
